Compliance module will handle all the logic related to the mask,selfie, bag and other checks we will add in the future flows in the future.

Note:- Do not add compliance related logic in container just the integration with compliance module
    - It will have the logic when to display a particular check
    - How many times we have to display a particular check
    - Feature configs related to Compliance Module

Idea here is to delegate all the compliance related check logics to the compliance module
